# To do
- ~~Lasso selection of nodes~~
- Group / Hide nodes?
- Proper Synth node support - amp envelope etc - hold key to keep note playing
- ~~Envelope follower node~~i
- More example patches
- Group tools by type, remove redundant tools
- Give values names (any node?)
- ~~better selection of cables~~
- Make nodes mono by default, add stereo inputs/outputs where needed (audio out etc)
- Panner - use circular qwpanning law
- type precise values
- Record button / render output
- Fix custom load button
- Allow midi in to control parameters / synth nodes
- Regroup parameters seperately from audio inputs
- Adjustable monitoring scope speed / range
- FFT viewer / scope, make stereo output waveform stereo
- Reimplement diffuser node with allpass delays
- Parameter without any control (no slider etc?)
- Inverter could be merged into gain?
- Component node to combine multiple nodes into one (edit components in separate view, the input and outputs of the component node flow into the internal nodes)
- Reimplement householder diffuser node as audio worklet
- copy/paste to clipboard (as json)
- LFO & Chaos phase slider
